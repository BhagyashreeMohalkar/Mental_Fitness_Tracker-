# 🧠 Mental Fitness Tracker using Machine Learning

This project analyzes mental health and substance use disorder data across countries and years to predict **mental fitness levels** using machine learning models. Built as part of the IBM Internship Projects, the system uses **Linear Regression** and **Random Forest Regressor** to understand and forecast mental health trends.

---

## 📌 Overview

- Predicts the level of mental fitness based on historical global data on disorders such as depression, anxiety, schizophrenia, and substance abuse.
- Merges and processes two comprehensive public health datasets.
- Visualizes year-wise and country-wise trends using interactive graphs.
- Implements and compares multiple regression models.

## ✨ Features

- 📊 Data visualization with Seaborn, Matplotlib, and Plotly
- ⚙️ Feature encoding and preprocessing
- 🤖 Machine learning with Scikit-learn
- 📈 Model evaluation with MSE, RMSE, and R² Score
- 🔁 Comparison of Linear Regression and Random Forest Regressor
